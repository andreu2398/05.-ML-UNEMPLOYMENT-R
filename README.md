# 05.-ML-UNEMPLOYMENT-R

Just testing some ML algorithms with this dataset with Spanish Unemployment.
Trying to figure out which algorithm is better predicting the month of the year by creating new variables that check the variation of unemployment.

*DISCLAIMER* -> I am completely aware of the Statistical problems that this solution causes:
  - Autocorrelation
  - Excess of variables
  - Redundant variables
  - Etc
 
 This is just a test of the algorithms themselves. Nothing else.
